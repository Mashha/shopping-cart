# Shopping Cart

## Introduction

Online shopping store made with react. I've made a hero section with a call to action - to shop in the store. 

And i've added a few more sections in home page to make it look more real.
I've played around with horizontal scroll, which is mostly used in mobile, a bit in desktop version. 

In shop page, there are all the plants you can choose from, or you can sort them based on size of the plant. 

If you click on each plant, it will take to a new page, where you can read a bit more about it and add it to cart. 

And lastly, plants are added to cart (i used local storage), where you can change quantity or remove them. 

All the buttons on page are mock buttons of course, accept for the - add to cart - one. 

I've added framer motion library for page transition effects.

Design was made in figma. 

This project was tons of fun and i could go on to improve it even more.
